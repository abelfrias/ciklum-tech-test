# Ciklum Tech Test - Lottoland Games

## Introduction
This is a technical test for applying to Senior Front-End Developer role at Ciklum for Lottoland. It has been deployed using [**Preact**](https://preactjs.com/) and JavaScript ES6. The project structure follows an [**Atomic Design Model**](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), although Template and Page layers could be improved. The **test coverage is of 100%** in statements, branches, functions, and lines of code.

Regarding the layout, the website is responsive and has been tested with a minimum width of 320px and a maximum greater or equal to 1280px. The breakpoint that switches between mobile and desktop layout is at 768px. SCSS has been used for styling, and some features like variables (for colors) and loops (for repetitive font-face declarations) have been also employed.

## CLI Commands
The app can be run using the following Preact CLI commands:
``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# test the production build locally
npm run serve

# run tests with jest and enzyme
npm run test

# run tests with jest and enzyme, showing coverage results
npm run test -- --coverage
```
